# website_memes
This is going to be a website where at first it will link to three different
memes. It will have a heading and then a second heading with a brief explanation of the website.
Then it will have three links where it will redirect to three different websites, each website will have a 
h1 with the name of the meme and then it will proceed with an image of the meme. It will follow with an 
explanation and then a brief conclusion.

DIARY AND GOALS


Sun 6 Nov:
	The website will only be consisted of html right now, later on the CSS will be added.

-------------------------------------------------

Mon 7 Nov:
	Today we have created the index file where you can find several links to different websites that will explain
	different memes. We have created three different websites for three different memes.

-------------------------------------------------

Wed 16 Nov:
	Today we have applied css, we have tried to made it look nice but it was very hard with the current knowledge.
	This commit is to save the progress on the testing done. The red line borders have been stablished to help me 
	understand the layout of the website. My goal right now is to make the h1 "MEMES" background colour, to not 
	fill the entire website, rather than just a lil bit and still be at the center. 
	
	I have also been testing with the possibility of adding a video to the background, but i would rather use 
	animation to make the background more dynamic rather than having a static video as a background. In order
	to execute that I need more knowledge in css animation and a little bit of javascript.
