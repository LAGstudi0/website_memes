		<p>Pepe the Frog (/ˈpɛpeɪ/) is an Internet meme consisting of a green anthropomorphic frog with a 
humanoid body. Pepe originated in a 2005 comic by Matt Furie called Boy's Club. It became an Internet meme when 
its popularity steadily grew across Myspace, Gaia Online and 4chan in 2008. By 2015, it had become one of the most 
popular memes used on 4chan and Tumblr.[3] Different types of Pepe include "Sad Frog", "Smug Frog", "Angry Pepe", 
"Feels Frog", and "You will never..." Frog. Since 2014, 'rare Pepes' have been posted on the 'meme market' as if they 
were trading cards.</p>

		<p>Originally an apolitical character, Pepe was appropriated from 2015 to 2016 onward as a symbol of 
the alt-right movement. The Anti-Defamation League included Pepe in its hate symbol database in 2016, but said most 
instances of Pepe were not used in a hate-related context. Since then, Furie has expressed his dismay at Pepe 
being used as a hate symbol and has sued organizations for doing so.</p>
