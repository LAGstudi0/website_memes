		<p>Trollface or Troll Face is a rage comic meme image of a character wearing a mischievous smile, 
used to symbolise internet trolls and trolling. It is one of the oldest and most widely known rage comic faces.</p>
		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>Trollface was drawn in Microsoft Paint on September 19, 2008, by Carlos Ramirez, an 18-year-old 
Oakland college student. The image was published on Ramirez's DeviantArt page, "Whynne",[4] as part of a rage 
comic titled Trolls, about the pointless nature of trolling. Ramirez posted the image to the imageboard website 
4chan and other users started to share it. In the following months, Ramirez's drawing quickly gained traction 
on 4chan as the universal emoticon of an internet troll and a versatile rage comic character. From 4chan, Trollface 
spread to Reddit and Urban Dictionary in 2009, eventually reaching other internet image-sharing sites like 
Imgur and Facebook.</p>

<p>In March 2021, Ramirez announced his intention to sell a non-fungible token for Trollface.</p>
