		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Batman Slapping Robin, also known as "My Parents Are Dead," is an exploitable image of the DC 
Comics superhero Batman slapping his protégé Robin in mid-conversation. Taken from a comic book published in 1965, 
the single-panel illustration has inspired a series of parodies featuring custom-captioned speech bubbles on 4chan, 
Reddit and elsewhere.</p>
		<h2>Origin</h2>
		<p>According to the Comics Should Be Good Archive, the panel originated from the 1965 comic book 
"World’s Finest #153." The story is based around an alternate reality in which Batman believes that Superboy and 
Superman are responsible for the death of his father.</p>
		<p>The earliest known parody of the panel was submitted to the image-sharing website SFWChan[3] on 
June 10th, 2008, in which the speech bubble text is changed to have Robin ask Batman what his parents got him for 
Christmas (shown below), to which Batman responds with a slap while yelling "my parents are dead!!" (shown below)</p>
